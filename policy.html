      <h5>Face Data Collection and Usage</h5>
      <p>
        Our app allows users to upload face images to generate AI-enhanced
        photos and videos. These images are used to detect facial features and
        apply face-swap or facial animation effects within the app.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Face images are stored only on the user’s device and are never
          uploaded to our servers.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not collect, store, or analyze biometric or facial recognition
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          One active face image is retained locally to allow users to reuse
          their selected face in future sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users can replace or delete their stored face image at any time within
          the app.

          No face data is shared with third parties under any circumstances.
